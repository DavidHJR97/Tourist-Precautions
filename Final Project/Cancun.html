                <p>
                    While being in Cancun it's best to be in groups. Whether you are in a club or on a excursions, do not seperate from the people you are with. 
                    Always carry dollars and pesos. People are going to ask for a tip whether its your driver, server, bartender, or the crew that was on the boat.

                <h3>Traveling Tip & Precautions</h3>
                <p>
                    Make sure to plan ahead and book everything on time. Especially when you are at the Cancun airport, you want to have your taxi or who ever is going to take you to your 
                    hotel or airbnb there ready for you. There are many companies that will offer you take to you, but its best to have someone already there. You also don't want to be in line waiting 
                    to rent a car. Any paper work that they give you, make sure to fill it out completely and dont' lose anything that they give you at the airport.
