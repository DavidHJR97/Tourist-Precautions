                </p>
				Some places that you can visit while being in Mexico City are:
                <ul class="third">
					<li>Eiffel Tower</li>
                    <li>Louvre Museum</li>

                    Paris brings alot of attraction to tourist because of what it has to offer. Unfortunately bad things can happen here. Like the attacks that occured on November 13, 2015.
                    The attacks left 130 dead, and hundreds were wounded. Like in any other place you have to be aware of your sourroundings and know what is going on. You also have to be
                    aware of people reaching to your pockets to take whatever you have whether it's money, cards, etc. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another downfall about Paris is the scammers. There will also be beggars that will ask you for money. If there are people that are looking like they want to approach you, it would
                    probably be better to walk away to another direction. Another thing to keep in mind is the aiport. According to people that have been to the airport in Paris say that it gets crazy.
                    The lines are very long and there are not many seats for the travelers to sit on.
