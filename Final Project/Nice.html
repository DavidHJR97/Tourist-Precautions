                    Safety tips and precautions while being in Nice
                </h3>

                    Every place that you go visit has it's pros and cons. One of the great things about Nice is you get to explore the cities and the towns around. One of the things that many
                    tourist dislike about Nice is the beach. According to the tourist the beach is sloppy and rocky. Like any other trip that you make, you should where you are going to be staying 
                    at so you won't be finding a place. You should also have your transportation planned out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nice is a pretty safe place to go visit, but you should take some precautions. Some things that you should keep in mind is to not be walking around the city at night in the dark. Since 
                    you probably don't know around very much, you do not want to risk anything. This includes being at the beach at the night time. You should probably also not go to towns or places that 
                    do not look welcoming. Stick to going to places where they are several peope wandering around.
