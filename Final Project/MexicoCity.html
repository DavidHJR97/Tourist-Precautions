                    Mexico City attracts many tourist because of the variety of places that you can go see. Unfortunately there are many downsides when visiting Mexico City. 
                    The first thing that you should be aware of is the pollution. The pollution in Mexico City is getting worse every year. One one the reasons for the pollution in Mexico City 
                    is are the cars. With that being said, the traffic in Mexico City is bad. So when you are in Mexico City make sure to have everything planned out. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another downfall about Mexico City is the crimes that occur. There will be burglars that will try to grab a womens purse and run.  There will also probably be people 
                    around you that could be involved with the drug cartels, which can bring risk with it. You should be aware of your sourroundings, and again, do not go anywhere by yourself.
